# Hi there, I'm [Syed Nabil Mahmud] 👋

I'm an Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) student at North South University (NSU) with a passion for learning fast, solving real-world problems, and an EXPLORER of this modern age.
My brain runs on **dopamine**, **glutamate**, and **acetylcholine** — the neurotransmitters of motivation, memory, and focus — and I find calm in that post-learning peace ✨

### 🔧 What I Do

- ⚡ Working with AutoCAD, Multisim, Logisim, MATLAB, and both analog & digital circuit design  
- 💡 Interested in embedded systems, electrical systems, robotics, AI/deep learning, neural networks, and military-grade tech & weapon systems  
- 🧠 Learning fast is my thing — I love reverse-engineering concepts until they click  
- 🎮 I play games when I feel like it — exams or not. Favorites include:  
  *Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, PUBGM, War Thunder, Red Dead Redemption 2, GTA V, Elden Ring, and Minecraft (with a self-modified resource pack for maximum immersion and detail)*  
- 🔍 When I'm tired of gaming, I switch to self-research — mostly about ongoing regional or global issues

### 🧊 Cold Facts About Me

- 🛠️ I take my desktop apart every month to clean it — and I’m pretty sure my laptop hates me by now  
- 🎨 I once tried painting it with acrylics (total disaster), so I covered the mess with washi tape and sanded it smooth later  
- 🔧 To play PUBG on Phoenix OS, I pulled out the CMOS battery to skip the BIOS password (ended up breaking the pins!), and it’s been without a BIOS battery since 2020  
- 🔐 Eventually I found a YouTube video with just 43 views that had the password—installed PUBG, got bored, and then wiped the OS
- 🦠 COVID-19 hit six months into my college life. Lockdown happened. Online classes started, but I didn’t attend any. Result? Almost zero real learning from college
